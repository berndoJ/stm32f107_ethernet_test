# stm32f107_ethernet_test

This is just a test firmware for the STM32F107 microcontroller.

This firmware uses libopencm3 as a hardware abstraction layer + the LwIP-stack for implementing TCP/IP. The PHY used is a LAN8742A, for more information on the HW used, please visit my [IntelliModule-Alpha](https://github.com/berndoJ/IntelliModule-Alpha) Github repository / project.
